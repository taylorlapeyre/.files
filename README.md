#### This is my default configuration for unix systems.

I use [Cider](https://github.com/msanders/cider) for installing my things. Feel free to use that as well:

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/taylorlapeyre/.files ~/.cider
$ pip install cider
$ cider restore
```

A firm understanding of the Unix toolchain is recommended before putting them onto your system.

If you asked me,

> Taylor, what are your _favorite tools ever_?

I'd probably recommend using [Atom][atom] as your primary editor, [Google Chrome][chrome] as your browser, and [Bash][bash] as your shell.

[bash]: http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/
[atom]: http://atom.io
[chrome]: https://google.com/chrome
