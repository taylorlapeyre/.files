# .files

This is my default configuration for unix systems.

### Installation

I use [Cider](https://github.com/msanders/cider) for installing my things. Feel free to use that as well:

``` bash
$ ln -s ~/.files ~/.cider
$ pip install cider
$ cider restore
```

A firm understanding of the Unix toolchain is recommended before putting them onto your system.
