# .files

This is my default configuration for unix systems. If you think you might want to use these, I suggest reading the files and taking ideas instead of copying them directly.

### Philosophy

The best amount of configuration is the least amount of configuration. Anything that works properly by default stays that way.

I should be able to clone this directory and be productive in less than 10 minutes.

### Installation

I use [Cider](https://github.com/msanders/cider).

``` bash
$ ln -s ~/.files ~/.cider
$ pip install cider
$ cider restore
```
